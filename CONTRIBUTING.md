# 🤝 Contributing to Azrea’s Daily Companion Tracker

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is personal but also open for collaboration.

---

## 📌 Branch Policy
- **main** → Stable code only. Used for releases.  
- **testing/v1.0.0** → Active development branch. All new features go here.  
- **feature/*** → Temporary feature branches if needed.

⚠️ **Never push directly to `main`** unless promoting from `testing`.

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup
1. Clone repo:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:azrea-shade/Azreas-Daily-Companion-Tracker.git
cd Azreas-Daily-Companion-Tracker
```
2. Install requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run app:  
```bash
python app/main.py
```

---

## 🧭 Code Style
- Python 3.10+  
- Use **PEP8** for style  
- Commit messages: short & descriptive  
  - `feat: add watchlist manager`  
  - `fix: crash on stock search`  
  - `docs: update README`  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Make changes in `testing/v1.0.0` (or a `feature/*` branch).  
2. Commit + push.  
3. Open Pull Request if needed.  
4. Once tested, merge into `main` for release.

💡 This keeps things clean so my dad always downloads a **stable installer** from `main`.
